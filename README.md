# NYC Bike Sharing Data

## Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze Citibike Data from August 2019 in New York City, and use this analysis to predict how a similar citibike expansion would work in Des Moines, Iowa. While the two cities are rather different, trends in the data can help provide insights.

The Tableau Story can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bradley8529/viz/CitibikeDemoProject/Story1?publish=yes).

## Results

The following visualizations are from the August 2019 New York City Citibike date:

</p>

<h5 align="center">
The graph above shows that majority of Citibike users have trips less then an hour, and trips longer are relatively few. It can also be seen that most rides using Citibikes are less than a half hour, with the peak number of rides being aorund 5 minutes.

<h3 align="center">Graph 2: Trip Duration by Gender</h3>

</p>

<h5 align="center">
The graph above breaks down the length of trips using Citibikes by gender, which shows that each gender follows a similar trip duration trend where majority are less than a half hour. The peak trip duration for each gender is: 5 minutes for Males, 6 minutes for Females, and 11 minutes for unknown user genders.

<h3 align="center">Graph 3: Number of Trips per Hour by Day</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/bradleywb426/bikesharing/blob/main/images/viz3.png" width="900">
</p>

<h5 align="center">
The above graph shows that there are two trends for popular times to use Citibikes. During the weekdays, Citibikes are most popular from 7AM - 9AM and 4PM - 7PM. During the weekend, Citibikes are most popular from around 10AM - 5PM.

<h3 align="center"> Graph 4: Number of Trips by Gender per Hour by Day</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/bradleywb426/bikesharing/blob/main/images/viz4.png" width="900">
</p>

<h5 align="center">
The above graph follows the same Citibike usage trends as Graph 3 (where the weekdays have a peak in the morning and evening while the weekends have a midday peak), but the trend is clearest in Males, then Females, and is hard to distinguish in unknown user genders.
</h5>

<h3 align="center"> Graph 5: Number of Trips per Day by Gender and User Type</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/bradleywb426/bikesharing/blob/main/images/viz5.png">
</p>

<h5 align="center">
The graph above has several key features. First, Citibike subscribers use a higher volume of bikes than Customers, and Males use the bikes the most out of all Subscribers. Secondly, it can be seen (particularly in Male Subscribers) that Thursday and Friday are the most popular days for Citibike usage. Lastly, though hard to tell in all sections of the chart, Subscribers use Citibikes fairly consitently throughout the week while Customers have slight peaks in usage over the weekends.

<h3 align="center"> Graph 6: Most Popular Starting Locations</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/bradleywb426/bikesharing/blob/main/images/viz6.png">
</p>

<h5 align="center">
The graph above shows that Citibikes are used all throughout New York City, and see are particularly high usage in more busy and tourist-heavy areas of the city. 
</h5>

<h3 align="center"> Graph 7: Peak Usage Hours Throughout August</h3>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/bradleywb426/bikesharing/blob/main/images/viz7.png">
</p>

<h5 align="center">
The graph shows throughout the whole month of August, the peak hours of usage are from 7AM - 9AM and 4PM - 7PM. It can also be shown that Citibikes are used the least from 2AM - 5AM.
</h5>

## Summary

Citibikes are prominently used in metropolitan cities and see a fairly consistent use throughout the day, particularly with Male Subscribers. it is also seen that Citibikes are likely used for commuting to and from work during the week, and during the middle of the days during the weekend. Together, this would provide a notable and fairly consistent income through Citibikes. Citibike popularity is likely tied to their ability to effectively bypass the density of cars and traffic in cities, avoid having to find and pay for parking, and ability to move to destinations quickly. The bikes also have a fairly reliable repair window in the early morning to avoid interfering with profits.

For future visualizations, it would be beneficial to look at how Citibikes performed over the course of either a month or a year to help identify trends in market growth and areas for expansion. Another helpful visualization would be to look at trip distance as a whole to find information on where are the most biked areas and most popular paths to provide better bike access.
